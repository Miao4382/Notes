Some other manipulations are (~A~ and ~B~ are two integers):
- set union: 
- set intersection: 
- set substraction: 
- set negation: all 1-bit -> 0-bit, all 0-bit -> 1-bit 
  - 
  - 
- opposite sign (a -> -a): 
- set bit: 
- clear bit: 
- test bit: 
- extract last bit: get the significance of the last 1-bit (its position), keeping all zeros from the last bit to rightmost zero.
  - 
  - 
  - 
- remove last bit: 
- get ~ALL_ONE_BITS~:
- a ^ a =
- 0 ^ a =
