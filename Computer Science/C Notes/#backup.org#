*** Some Facts
- assignments associate from right to left.
- arithemetic operators associate left to right
- relational operators have lower precedence than arithmetic operators
- expressions connected by ~&&~ or ~||~ are evaluated left to right. ~&&~ has a higher precedence than ~||~, both are lower than relational and equality operators. (higher than assignment operators?)
- printable characters are always positive
- The standard headers ~<limits.h>~ and ~<float.h>~ contain symbolic constants for all of the sizes of basic data types, along with other properties of the machine and compiler.
- a leading 0 (zero) on an integer constant means octal
- a leading ~0x~ or ~0X~ (zero x) means hexadecimal.
- you can use escape sequence to represent number. Check it at p51. The complete set of escape sequences are in p52.
- ~strlen()~ function and other string functions are declared in the standard header ~<string.h>~.
- external and static variables are initialized to zero by default.
- for portability, specify ~signed~ or ~unsigned~ if non-character data is to be stored in ~char~ variables. (p58)
- to perform a type conversion:
  #+begin_src c
  double a = 2.5;
  printf("%d", (int) a);  
  #+end_src
  result will be ~2~.
- unary operator associate right to left (like ~*~, ~++~, ~--~)

place holder.

*** headers
- ~<stdio.h>~: contains input/output functions
- ~<ctype.h>~: some functions regarding to characters
  
*** ~printf()~ formatting
Check p26-p27 of the textbook.

Use ~%~ with symbols to print the variables in different format.
Example:
#+begin_src c
printf("%c", a)  //print a in format of character
printf("%s", a)  //print a in format of character string
printf("%nc", a)  //print a in format of character, using a character width of size n (at least)
printf("%f", a)  //print a in format of float
printf("%nf", a)  //print a in format of float, using a width of size n
printf("%n.0f", a)  //print a in format of float, using a character width of size n, with no decimal point and no fraction digits
printf("%n.mf", a)  //print a in format of float, using a character width of size n, with decimal point and m fraction digits
printf("%0.mf", a)  //print a in format of float, with decimal point and m fraction digits. The width is not constrained.
printf("%d", a)  //print a in format of integer
printf("%o", a)  //print a in format of octal integer
printf("%x", a)  //print a in format of hexadecimal integer
#+end_src
*** Symbolic Constants
A ~#define~ line defines a symbolic name or symbolic constants to be a particular string of characters. You use it like: ~#define~ /name/ /replacement text/. You put this at the head of your code (outside scope of any function to make it globally). Example:
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

#define LOWER 0
#define UPPER 300
#define STEP 20

int main() {
  
  for (int i = LOWER; i <= UPPER; i += STEP) {
    printf("%5d\t%20f", i, 5 * (i - 32) / 9.0);
    printf("\n");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
#+end_src
Pay attention that symbolic name or symbolic constants are not variables. They are conventionally written in upper case. No semicolon at the end of a ~#define~ line.
*** Character Input and Output
- ~getchar()~: it reads the next input character from a text stream and returns that (from the buffer?).
- ~putchar()~: it prints a character each time it is called and passed a char into.

Pay attention that a character written between single quotes represents an integer value equal to the numerical value of the character in the machine's character set. This is called a character constant. For example, ~'a'~ is actually ~97~.
*** Arrays
The syntax is similar with C++. For example, to define an array of integers with a size of 100, you do:
#+begin_src c
int nums[100];
#+end_src
Remember to initialize each slot:
#+begin_src c
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
  nums[i] = 0;
#+end_src

You can also to use assignment operator and ~{ }~ to initialize the array when defining. For example, the following C-string is initialized when being defined:
#+begin_src c
int main() {
  char s[] = {'a', 'b', 'c' };
  printf("%s", s);
  return 0;
}
#+end_src
*** Enumeration constant
An enumeration is a list of constant integer values. For example:
#+begin_src c
enum boolean { NO, YES };
#+end_src
The first name in an ~enum~ has value 0, the next 1, and so on, unless explicit values are specified:
#+begin_src c
enum boolean { YES = 1, NO = 0 };
#+end_src

If not all values are specified, unspecified values continue the progression from the last specified value:
#+begin_src c
enum months { JAN = 1, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC };
// FEB is 2, MAR is 3, etc.
#+end_src

Names in different enumerations must be distinct. Values need not be distinct in the same enumeration. Enumeration works like using ~#define~ to associate constant values with names:
#+begin_src c
#define JAN 1
#define FEB 2
// etc
#+end_src
*** type-cast an expression
Explicit type conversions can be forced ("coerced") in any expression. For example:
#+begin_src c
int main() {
  int n = 2;
  printf("%f", (float) n);
  return 0;
}
#+end_src
In the above example, when being printed, the type of ~n~ has been modified to ~float~. Notice that ~n~ itself is not altered. This is called a /cast/, it is an unary operator, has the same high precedence as other unary operators.
*** Bitwise operators
p62

There are 6 bitwise operators for bit manipulation. They may be applied to integral operands only.

They are:
- ~&~  : bitwise AND
- ~|~  : bitwise inclusive OR
- ~^~  : bitwise exclusive OR
- ~<<~ : left shift
- ~>>~ : right shift
- =~=  : one's complement (unary)

The precedence of the bitwise operators ~&~, ~^~ and ~|~ is lower than ~==~ and ~!=~.
*** Operators can be used with assignment operators
p64

~+, -, *, /, %, <<, >>, &, ^, |~
*** External Variables
If an external variables is to be referred to before it is defined, or if it is defined in a different source file from the one where it is being used, then an ~extern~ declaration is mandatory. For example, a function using external variables in a different source file can declare these variables in following manner:
#+begin_src c
int addNum(int a) {
  extern int ADDAMOUNT;  // variable ADDAMOUNT is in different source file

  return a + ADDAMOUNT;
}
#+end_src
Array sizes must be specified with the definition, but are optional with an ~extern~ declaration.
*** Command-line Arguments
p128 in CPL.

We can pass command-line arguments or parameters to a program when it begins executing. An example is the echo program. On the command prompt, you enter ~ehco~, followed by a series of arguments:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ echo hello world
#+END_EXAMPLE
then press enter. The command line window will repeat the inputed arguments:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ echo hello world
$ hello world
#+END_EXAMPLE
The two strings ~"hello"~ and ~"world"~ are two arguments passed in echo program.

Basically, when ~main()~ is called, it is called with two arguments: ~argc~ and ~argv~.
- ~argc~: stands for argument count. It is the number of command-line arguments when the program was invoked (i.e. how many strings are there in the line that invoked the program). In the above echo example, ~argc == 3~, the three strings are: "echo", "hello" and "world", respectively.
- ~argv~: stands for argument vector. It is a pointer to an array of character strings that contain the actual arguments, one per string. You can imagine when you type in command line to invoke a program, what you typed in was stored somewhere in an array of character strings. Additionally, the standard requires that ~argv[argc]~ be a null pointer. In the echo example, you typed "echo hello world", and following array of characters was stored:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ["echo", "hello", "world", 0]
  #+END_EXAMPLE

**** Example: ~echo~
Knowing this, we can write a program that mimic the ~echo~ function: re-print what we typed in when we invoke the program to terminal:
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  while (*(++argv))
    printf("%s%s", *argv, *(argv + 1) ? " " : "");  // the second %s is for the space
  
  printf("\n");
  
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

**** Example: ~pattern_finding~
This program will try to find any lines in the input buffer that contains the keyword passed in when invoking it. For example, in command line prompt:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ pattern_finding love < text.txt
#+END_EXAMPLE
it will print all lines that contain ~love~ to the terminal.

The program uses ~strstr()~ to search the existence of a certain keyword in target string. We also write a ~getline()~ function to get one single line from input buffer (using ~getchar()~). Pay attention that in the new C library (~stdio.h~), a ~getline()~ function has been added. So we rename our function to ~getlines()~. The code is as follows:
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define MAXLINE 1000

int getlines(char* line, int max);

//find: print lines that match pattern from 1st arg 
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  char line[MAXLINE];  // used to hold a line of string
  int found = 0;
  
  if (argc != 2)
    printf("Usage: find pattern\n");
  else
    while (getlines(line, MAXLINE) > 0)
      if (strstr(line, argv[1]) != NULL) {
        printf("No.%d: %s", ++found, line);
      }
  
  return found;
}

int getlines(char* line, int max) {
  char ch;
  
  while (--max > 0 && (ch = getchar()) != EOF && ch != '\n') {
    *(line++) = ch;
  }
  
  if (ch == '\n')
    *(line++) = ch;  // no need to worry about not enough space, since if ch == '\n', it is not stored in line yet, because the loop was not executed
  *line = '\0';
  
  if (ch == EOF)
    return -1;
  
  return 1;
}
#+end_src

**** Optional arguments example: ~pattern_finding~ extended
Now we extend our ~pattern_finding~ program so it can accept optional arguments. A convention for C programs on UNIX systems is that an argument that begins with a minus sign introduces an optical flag or parameter. Optional arguments should be permitted in any order, they can also be combined (a minus sign with two or more optional arguments, without space between each other).

There is no magic about optional arguments. They are collected as strings in ~argv[]~ when the program is invoked, just like anyother strings occured when invoking the function. We extend the ~pattern_finding~ program to include support for two optional arguments:
1. -x: print lines that doesn't contain the target pattern;
2. -n: in addition to print lines, the program will also print the corresponding line number before the line.
So, the program can be invoked in following way:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ pattern_finding -n -x keyword < text.txt
#+END_EXAMPLE
in this case, when ~main()~ is called, ~argc == 4~, ~*argv == {"pattern_finding", "-n", "-x", "keyword"}~. ~< text.txt~ is just redirect ~stdin~ to the text.

Or, we can combine the two optional arguments:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ pattern_finding -xn keyword < text.txt
#+END_EXAMPLE
in this case, when ~main()~ is called, ~argc == 3~, ~*argv == {"pattern_finding", "-xn", "keyword"}~.

Thus, we have to write code to analyze argument strings that has ~"-xxx"~ form. Generally, we keep a list of flags inside the program. If we encountered any optional argument in the string, we can set the corresponding flag to true.

The code and explanation is as follows:
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define MAXLINE 1000

int getlines(char* line, int max);

//find: print lines that match pattern from 1st arg 
// with optional arguments enabled
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  char line[MAXLINE];  // temporary container to hold line read from buffer
  char c;  // to check optional arguments 
  
  int line_num = 0;  // record the number of line                                                             
  int except = 0;  // flag of optional argument x, if this is true, print lines that doesn't have pattern  
  int number = 0;  // flag for optional argument n , if this is true, print the corresponding line number
  int found = 0;
  
  
  // check inputted arguments and set flag accordingly
  // use prefix to skip the first argv (which is the name of the function)
  while (--argc > 0 && (*++argv)[0] == '-')  // outter while loop check each "-xxx" styled optional argument 
    while (c = *++argv[0]) {  // inner while loop check each char in the "-xxx" styled argument
      switch (c) {
      case 'x':
        except = 1;
        break;
      case 'n':
        number = 1;
        break;
      default:
        printf("find: illegal option %c\n", c);
        argc = 0;  // this will terminate the program
        found = -1;
        break;
      }
    }
    
  if (argc != 1)  //we should have only one argument at this point, which is the pattern we are going to find. All optional arguments have been examed by the previous while loop 
    printf("Usage: find -x -n pattern\n");  // print a message showing how to use this program
  else
    while (getlines(line, MAXLINE) > 0) {
      line_num++;  // update the line number
      
      /*Notes: 
        Print the line based on value of variable except and the found result.
        To print a line, the truth value of found and except should be different. When except = 1, we print lines that not found, so found == 0;
        When except = 0, we print lines that are found, so found == 1;
      */
      if ((strstr(line, *argv) != NULL) != except) {
        if (number)  // if the number flag is true, we print the line number 
          printf("%d", line_num);
        printf("%s", line);
        found++;
      }
      
    }
    
  return found;
    
}

int getlines(char* line, int max) {
  char ch;
  
  while (--max > 0 && (ch = getchar()) != EOF && ch != '\n') {
    *(line++) = ch;

*** Pointers to Functions
It is possible to define pointers to functions, which can be assigned, placed in arrays, passed to functions, returned by functions, and so on.

To declare a pointer to a function, you write:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
return_type (*ptr_name)(parameter1_type, parameter2_type, ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE
Explanation:
- ~return_type~: the return type of the function this pointer pointing to.
- ~ptr_name~: the name of the pointer variable
- ~parameter_type~: the type of the function this pointer referring to.

Example:
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define MAXLINES 5000  // max number of lines to be sorted

char* lineptr[MAXLINES];  // an array of char pointers to text lines

int readlines(char* lineptr[], int maxlines);
void writelines(char* lineptr[], int nlines);
// the fourth parameter is a pointer to function, we may choose different comparing functions to be used in sorting 
void qsorts(void* lineptr[], int left, int right, int (*comp)(void*, void*));
int numcmp(char*, char*);

// with optional arguments
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  int nlines;  // hold the total number of lines read
  int numeric = 0;  // flag of -n option; 1 if numeric sort requested 
  
  // check if optional argument is typed
  if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], "-n") == 0)
    numeric = 1;
  
  // read lines and sort according to numeric value
  if ((nlines = readlines(lineptr, MAXLINES)) >= 0) {
    /* qsorts(lineptr, 0, nlines - 1); */
    qsorts((void **) lineptr, 0, nlines - 1, (int (*)(void*, void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp));
    
    writelines(lineptr, nlines);
    return 0;
  }
  
  else {
    printf("error: input too big to sort\n");
    return 1;
  }

}

#define MAXLEN 1000  // max length of any input line

- use getlines() function to get each line from the input buffer and store in line[] variable; Also store the length of each line (not including )
- call alloc() to request a chunk of memory from a pre-allocated memory space (reservoir), a pointer to this chunk of memory will hold the address
- call strcpy() to copy content in line[] to the requested chunk of memory
- store the memory address hold in p to lineptr[]'s slots

Example: read lines, sort and print on terminal (with optional argument supporting)

The sorting program has following feature:
1. the program can be invoked by ~$ sort -n < text.txt~ or ~$ sort < text.txt~
2. if optional argument ~-n~ is used, the lines will be sorted numerically, otherwise, lines will be sorted lexicographically
3. read all lines of input and store them
4. sort the lines by sorting pointers pointing to them (based on wether ~-n~ is given or not)
5. print the lines in order 

For the base program (read lines and qsort them), please check the corresponding example code (example_5-6). 

Code for this part (along with explanations) can be found at: example_5-11. It's a mess to put all codes here.
